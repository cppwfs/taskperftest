# Task Performance Application
The purpose this application is to load up a database with a large number of task definitions
and task executions to exercise Spring Cloud Data Flow.


## Getting Started

### Building

```bash
mvn clean install
```


### Executing the app
By default, running the application without any properties, the application will
create 10 task definitions prefixed with `perfTestTask` using the local instance of dataflow at port 9393.
For example:
```bash
java -jar target/perftask-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If you add database connection properties, the application will create 10 task executions. (1 for each task definition)

#### Configuration
* taskPrefix - The prefix to be used for task definition names. Defaults to `perfTestTask`.
* taskDefinitionCount - Then number of definitions to create. Defaults to `10`.
* addTaskExecutions - If true task executions will be created by launching tasks. Defaults to `true`.
* taskExecutionCount -The number of task executions to be inserted into the task execution table.  Defaults to `10`.
